### [Documentation on features can be found here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki)

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use the pokeemerald Expansion
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of the Expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of the pokeemerald Expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.6.2`.

### Please consider crediting the entire [list of contributors](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki/Credits) in your project, as they have all worked hard to develop this project :)

## There's a bug in the project. How do I let you guys know?
Please submit any issues with the project [here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/issues). Make sure that the issue wasn't reported by someone else by searching using the filters.

## Can I contribute even if I'm not a member of ROM Hacking Hideout?

Yes! Contributions are welcome via Pull Requests and they will be reviewed by maintainers. Don't feel discouraged if we take a bit to review your PR, we'll get to it.

## Who maintains the project?

The project was originally started by DizzyEgg alongside other contributors.

The project has now gotten larger and DizzyEgg is now maintaining the project as part of the ROM Hacking Hideout community. Some members of this community are taking on larger roles to help maintain the project.

## What is ROM Hacking Hideout?

A Discord-based ROM hacking community that has many members who hack using the disassembly and decompilation projects for Pokémon. Quite a few contributors to the original feature branches by DizzyEgg were members of ROM Hacking Hideout. You can call it RHH for short!

# Pokémon Emerald

This is a fork of the [matching decompilation](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) at [PRET](https://github.com/pret).

This fork tries to maintain vanilla compatibility whenever possible. It doesn't increase the size of any save data structure or the object event structure.

There are several branches, each with one main feature (and sometimes some extra stuff):

**followers** branch:
* [HGSS-style pokémon followers](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Walking_Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver) for all 386 pokémon, including emotes, the 28 Unown forms and a majority of follower messages.
* Dynamic overworld palettes & reflections compatible with vanilla berry trees.
* PID (but not legitimacy) preserving Pokémon nature-changing function
* Function to detect modern emulators/GBA hardware.

**icons** branch:
* Everything from the **followers** branch.
* All pokemon icons updated to Gen 6, based on [this repo](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite/tree/master/icons/pokemon/regular)
* This includes compatibility with the PC, trade, contests, mail, Battle Dome. Examples:
![PC](https://i.imgur.com/wzwJfd1.png)
![Party](https://i.imgur.com/8hbE88t.png)
![Contest](https://i.imgur.com/S9mCEFL.png)
* Icons share palettes with front sprites, meaning that shiny pokemon will also have shiny icons!

**lighting** branch:
* Everything from the **followers** branch.
* Day/night shading compatible with weather.
* GSC-style window lights.
* WIP interframe-blended lamp lights at night, i.e in Rustboro.
* HGSS-style alpha-blended shadows for object events.

**key-item-wheel** branch:
- ORAS-style Key Item wheel.
- Allows registering up to **4** Key Items.
- Vanilla-compatible, repurposes some unused rematch slots in the saveblock.
- Only takes up 1 sprite palette slot, and reuses 2 BG palette slots.
- Works in dark caves and with many sprites loaded.

![No Item](https://i.imgur.com/VY26Tww.gif)
![Multiple items](https://i.imgur.com/VKSQCz3.gif)
![Many sprites](https://i.imgur.com/qdNUDxq.gif)
![Flash caves](https://i.imgur.com/mlDA64c.gif)

Additional branches  to mention:

* `followers-expanded-id` - like `followers`, but includes backwards-compatible 16-bit graphics IDs for object events.
* `lighting-expanded-id` - like the above but for `lighting`.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## FAQ
### Q: How do I mark certain colors in a palette as light-blended?
A: Create a `.pla` file in the same folder as the `.pal` with the same name.

In this file you can enter color indices [0,15]
on separate lines to mark those colors as being light-blended, i.e:

`06.pla:`
```
# A comment
0 # if color 0 is listed, uses it to blend with instead of the default!
1
9
10
```

You might have to `make mostlyclean` or change the `.pal` file to pick up the changes.
